              Priyanshi‚Ä¶ oh wait, Peiyanshi üòÉ

              From the very first moment we met, I felt something different‚Äîsomething special that I couldn‚Äôt quite explain. That feeling has only grown stronger with time. Every day with you feels like a new chapter in our story, filled with so much joy, laughter, and memories that I‚Äôll always treasure.
              
              You‚Äôre the light in my life, the warmth that makes everything better, and the calm that keeps me grounded. You‚Äôve made my life more meaningful, more beautiful, and more complete. I‚Äôve come to realize that everything I‚Äôve ever wanted has been right here with you.
              
              As we‚Äôve gotten to know each other, I‚Äôve seen how incredible you are‚Äîkind, caring, smart, and strong in ways you might not even realize. You inspire me to be better, and I‚Äôm so grateful to have you in my life. With you, I feel like I‚Äôve found where I truly belong.
              
              Peiyanshi, I want to spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you‚Äôve made me. I want to share every moment with you, through all the ups and downs, and grow together.
              
              I know I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm always trying my best to make you feel comfortable and loved. I‚Äôm working on myself, trying to be stronger in every way so we can both grow together.

              pieyanshi,one thing i knew that you are weak from inside(i mean thats what i noticed idk if im wrong or correct) i found a version of me inside you , a silly a litlle goofy, actually you are perfect for me priyanshi
                
              It‚Äôs your choice to accept me, and if you‚Äôre happier without me, I‚Äôll respect that because your happiness is what matters most to me.
              
              But before anything else, I just want to say‚Ä¶ I love you, Peiyanshi. Will you be mine, from today and always?
              If you do agree? Oh god, it would melt my heart but I want this to be private as I don't want this all to be leaked in my school or family.
