              Priyanshi… oh wait, Peiyanshi 😃

              From the very first moment we met, I felt something different—something special that I couldn’t quite explain. That feeling has only grown stronger with time. Every day with you feels like a new chapter in our story, filled with so much joy, laughter, and memories that I’ll always treasure.
              
              You’re the light in my life, the warmth that makes everything better, and the calm that keeps me grounded. You’ve made my life more meaningful, more beautiful, and more complete. I’ve come to realize that everything I’ve ever wanted has been right here with you.
              
              As we’ve gotten to know each other, I’ve seen how incredible you are—kind, caring, smart, and strong in ways you might not even realize. You inspire me to be better, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life. With you, I feel like I’ve found where I truly belong.
              
              Peiyanshi, I want to spend the rest of my life making you as happy as you’ve made me. I want to share every moment with you, through all the ups and downs, and grow together.
              
              I know I’m not perfect, but I’m always trying my best to make you feel comfortable and loved. I’m working on myself, trying to be stronger in every way so we can both grow together.
              
              It’s your choice to accept me, and if you’re happier without me, I’ll respect that because your happiness is what matters most to me.
              
              But before anything else, I just want to say… I love you, Peiyanshi. Will you be mine, from today and always?
              If you do agree? Oh god, it would melt my heart but I want this to be private as I don't want this all to be leaked in my school or family.
